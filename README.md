# Simple Todo App

This is a basic to-do list app I built. You can add tasks with a name and a due date, and they’ll show up in a list. It’s clean, simple, and helps keep track of what you need to do.

## Functionality

You can add a new task by filling out a form

It gives each task a random ID so it's easy to manage

It puts the task on the page instantly without reloading

It checks the form to make sure you filled it out right

You can open and close the popup form easily

## Technology

HTML for the layout

CSS to style the page

JavaScript to make everything work

OOP (Todo, FormValidator) to keep the code clean and organized

I used a tool called uuidv4 to give each task a unique ID
